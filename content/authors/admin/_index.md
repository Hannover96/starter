I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [CRC 1114: Scaling Cascades in Complex Systems](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/sfb1114/index.html), working in the research group [Numerical Analysis](https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/professuren/numerische-mathematik) at the University of Potsdam led by [Prof. Sebastian Reich](https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/~sreich/). I am also associated to the [CRC 1294: Data Assimilation](https://www.sfb1294.de/). 

My research interests lie at the interface of computational statistics, machine learning, and the mathematics of stochastic dynamics and interacting particle systems.
