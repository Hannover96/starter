abstract: The numerical approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs) poses formidable challenges in high dimensions since classical grid-based methods suffer from the so-called curse of dimensionality. Recent attempts rely on a combination of Monte Carlo methods and variational formulations, using neural networks for function approximation. Extending previous work (Richter et al., 2021), we argue that tensor trains provide an appealing framework for parabolic PDEs.
