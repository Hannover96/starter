abstract: Optimal control of diffusion processes is intimately connected to the problem of solving certain Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Building on recent machine learning inspired approaches towards high-dimensional PDEs, we investigate the potential of iterative diffusion optimisation techniques, in particular considering applications in importance sampling and rare event simulation. The choice of an appropriate loss function being a central element in the algorithmic design, we develop a principled framework based on divergences between path measures, encompassing various existing methods. Motivated by connections to forward-backward SDEs, we propose and study the novel log-variance divergence, showing favourable properties of corresponding Monte Carlo estimators. The promise of the developed approach is exemplified by a range of high-dimensional and metastable numerical examples.
